Countdown timer app for refereeing sports matches. Two countdown timers are set and run together. The top timer shows the game time and runs continuously. The main timer shows actual game time including stoppages. When pressing the ENTER button the actual timer will start/ stop whilst the top timer will carry on running.

Usage:
* Menu soft key or up button to select default countdown time (can choose from 30:00, 40:00, 45:00 or Custom)
* Tap screen or press enter button (start/stop) to start and pause actual timer
* "Repeat" option in menu toggles auto-repeat mode

Make sure vibration is enabled to make the most of this app!
